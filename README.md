[Custom JavaScript for websites - Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/custom-javascript-for-web/poakhlngfciodnhlhhgnaaelnpjljija)

Run custom JavaScript on any website.
Use this tool to inject custom javascript in any website.

Your scripts are kept in the local storage and applied across domain URLs.

You can use jQuery 1.11.0 or 2.1.0 or your own external scripts.

Usage:
- site debugging (wrong list sort, etc.)
- hiding annoyng popups and Ads
- anything you can think of :)

New features:
- Ace Editor (formating, highlight, undo/redo by hotkeys)
- Draft auto save (so doesn't matter when you close the window without saving)
- Hosts (websites) switch (you can browse customjs of other websites)
- Include external script (eq. Underscore.js is cool)
